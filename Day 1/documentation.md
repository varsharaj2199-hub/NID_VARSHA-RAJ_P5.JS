Day 1 Task - Create a compositon for emotion 'Wonder'

IDEATION:

The first thing that came to my mind when I thought of wonder was the cosmic space, filled with twinkling stars, spherical planets of different shapes and sizes. In order to represent that picture into abstract shape, I decided to go with circles.
Then, I planned the look of the composition. For background, dark color suited the most to make the shapes glow.
Multiple circles of different sizes, colors, and positions helped to create harmonious compostion. I used soft pastels, glowing tones like lavender, yellow, blue, and pink â€” to give a dreamy, magical feeling.

CODING:

For coding, I first setup the canvas size in landscape mode, followed by adding ellipses overlapping each other at the centre. I randomly assigned the coordinates of some of the ellipses to make compositon more harmonious and balanced. Most of the ellipses are opaque without stroke. Some has no fill with strokes to give the outer ring like shape. The final composition looks like a magical sky full of glowing planets.

CHALLENGES:

- defining each ellipses
- adding fill to each circle with different rgb values

LEARNING:

I learned how  simple shapes can express complex emotions through color, scale, and placement. Just playing with strokes, fill can give a shape whole different character. The exercise helped me to understand how heirarchy is created based on the order the code is written.

Day 4 Task -  Create generative pattern using images

AIM:

To creates a dynamic grid pattern made of randomly chosen images.
Each cell in the grid displays one of four preloaded images, selected at random every frame.
The result is a continuously changing mosaic-like animation of pictures.

STEPS:
1. Image loading using preload()
2. Nested for loops for grid creation
3. Random selection using random() and floor()
4. Image rendering using image()
5. Frame rate control using frameRate()

RESULTS:

Each frame generates a random combination of images creating a different composition overall.

LEARNINGS:

1. Loading images to use in grid
2. How individual images can be joined to create a new composition each time
3. Using floor makes the random number between,for example 1 to 5, whole number( 1.33 becomes 1)
